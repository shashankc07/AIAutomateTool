Slide 2: Introduction

Title: What is the Portfolio Analysis Tool?
Content:

A tool to analyze and compare portfolio weights with benchmark weights.
Provides insights like overweight/underweight assets, deviations, and risk exposure.
Enhanced with Monte Carlo simulations for advanced risk assessment.
Slide 3: Key Features

Title: Key Features of the Tool
Content:

Portfolio vs Benchmark Comparison:
Identify deviations in asset weights.
Risk Analysis:
Calculate tracking error, Value at Risk (VaR), and Conditional VaR (CVaR).
Monte Carlo Simulations:
Simulate future portfolio performance under random scenarios.
Visualizations:
Charts and graphs for easy interpretation.
Slide 4: Workflow Overview

Title: How the Tool Works
Flowchart:

Input Data:
Portfolio weights (Excel).
Benchmark weights (Excel).
Data Processing:
Merge and compare portfolio vs benchmark.
Monte Carlo Simulations:
Simulate portfolio performance.
Generate Insights:
Overweight/underweight assets, risk metrics, and visualizations.
Slide 5: Data Preparation

Title: Step 1 - Data Preparation
Flowchart:

Load Data:
Portfolio and benchmark Excel files.
Clean Data:
Handle missing values, align asset names.
Merge Data:
Combine portfolio and benchmark for comparison.
Slide 6: Portfolio vs Benchmark Comparison

Title: Step 2 - Compare Portfolio and Benchmark
Flowchart:

Calculate Deviations:
Portfolio weight - Benchmark weight.
Identify Overweight/Underweight Assets:
Positive deviation = Overweight.
Negative deviation = Underweight.
Calculate Tracking Error:
Standard deviation of deviations.
Slide 7: Monte Carlo Simulations

Title: Step 3 - Monte Carlo Simulations
Flowchart:

Define Parameters:
Number of simulations, time horizon, expected returns, and volatility.
Generate Random Scenarios:
Simulate asset returns using statistical distributions.
Simulate Portfolio Performance:
Calculate portfolio value for each scenario.
Analyze Results:
Compute mean, standard deviation, VaR, and CVaR.
Slide 8: Risk Metrics

Title: Step 4 - Risk Metrics
Content:

Value at Risk (VaR):
Worst-case loss at a 95% confidence level.
Conditional VaR (CVaR):
Average loss in the worst 5% of scenarios.
Mean and Standard Deviation:
Expected portfolio value and risk.
Slide 9: Visualizations

Title: Step 5 - Visualize Results
Content:

Bar Chart:
Portfolio vs benchmark weights.
Histogram:
Distribution of simulated portfolio values.
Risk Metrics:
Highlight VaR and CVaR on the histogram.
